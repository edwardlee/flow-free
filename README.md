Flow free is a simple yet addictive C++ port of the mobile game Flow FreeÂ®. 

## Features
â˜… Over 39 free puzzles

â˜… Clean, colorful graphics

â˜… Fun sound effects

â˜… No ads

## Build
In addition to CMake, the game requires a local copy of [GE211](https://tov.github.io/ge211/) and SDL2.
Cloning <code>[.cs211/](https://github.com/jackburkhardt/ge211-spaceinvaders)</code> from Jack should also suffice.

Apparently statically linking SDL2 to a CMake project is an NP-hard problem, so I don't know how to offer a standalone executable yet.
